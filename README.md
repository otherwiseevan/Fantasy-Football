# Fantasy-Football

I'm attempting to create a data-driven strategy to win my fantasy football league for the 2025 Season. We know what actions lead to fantasy points like touchdowns, rushing yards, passing yards, catches, field goals, two-point conversions, etc. I want to know if there are other metrics to predict fantasy points. To get even more granular, are there particular match ups I should be aware of once the season starts that will yield greater points for my roster.
